This is my first Android app. I wanted to make a simple ad-free flashlight for my HTC One M7 phone that ran on Android 5.0.2. 

The problem with Android 5.0.2 is that it uses API level 21. This was the first level to transition to android.hardware.camera2 from android.hardware.camera. Camera2 at API level 21 did not yet have a nice, simple way to turn on the flashlight, so I used the deprecated Camera API.
